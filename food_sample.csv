Observed food handler touching face with hand/glove and did not remove glove - resumed duties Observed multiple employees multitasking wearing gloves - leaving & returning to work stations. If gloves are worn they shall be treated as a disposable utensil  *Helpful tips for glove use:  Gloves are task specific and should NEVER be worn continuously. They get contaminated just as bare hands do  so change them out frequently.  Wash your hands properly in between these changes  i.e. (a 20 second scrub with soap  warm water and dont forget to dry off with a clean paper towel).  Gloves are not a stand-alone protective barrier. As mentioned above  they are not 100% effective  but when combined with proper hand washing they significantly reduce the possibility of contaminating your customers food.  Gloves can still cross-contaminate. Dont touch the ready-to-eat food if you have just handled a raw piece of meat or eggs. Throw away the gloves  wash your hands  and put on a new pair.  If you touch a dirty surface with your glove (hair  nose  clothing  floor  equipment or utensils) the glove is dirty and you need to change them after washing your hands.  Bacteria from your skin continue to grow while underneath the gloves and that is why it is important to wash between handling the new gloves. Dont pre-contaminate your gloves.,115   Stuart ST,Boston,MA,02116,156115,"(42.351377000, -71.065481000)"
